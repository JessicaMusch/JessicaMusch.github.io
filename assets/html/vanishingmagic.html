            <h1>
                "Vanishing Magic"
            </h1>

            <p class="padding">
                 “Vanishing Magic” is the temporary name of my Game Design project from my 3rd semester. The goal was a Game Design Document including information about the setting, characters, story and gameplay. We also needed to include personas and analyse 3 competitors in the same genre as our game.     
                <br><br>
                 For this project I chose to use an old worldbuilding project I had already been working on for a few years and make a game out of it. As the project till then only included information about the world and places and not the characters, I had to create the characters and their story from scratch. In the following brief descriptions of the story and world of the game, I refrain from using any names for the places and characters, as I have since decided to work on the idea as a worldbuilding-only project for the foreseeable future, and the names do not fit the world anymore. 
            </p>

            <h3>
                Main Gameplay Idea
            </h3>

            <ul class="padding" id="bulletlist">
                <li>
                    The focus of the game lies on exploring the world and gathering knowledge about it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At the start of the game during character creation, the player will allocate a fixed number of points towards different skills the character could have. Maybe the character has more knowledge about magic, or he has learned more about history.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The player will be able to level up the skills of the character slowly through doing things that would increase the knowledge or skill in the relevant field. E.g. If the player reads books about history, his history-skill will improve over time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When the player explores the world, he will be able to interact with different objects, artefacts, or plants or speak with different people. Depending on his skills, he will find out different information from them. E.g., if the player knows a lot about magic and inspects a magical artefact, he will know how exactly and for what the magic is used in this artefact, whereas with more knowledge in history, the player will gain the information when this artefact was created and by whom and will only learn about the general use of it, but not how it works. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    This system is intended to make each run different and give the players every time they start a new game the opportunity to learn more about the world.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The player is able to gain the story-relevant information with any combination of skills, but he will need to gather the necessary information through different means, depending on his skills. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the original concept of the game, I did not include fighting as an ability, but the player could be able to hunt animals for food or other parts to sell them or create clothes or items from them.
                </li>
            </ul>

                    <h3>
                        The Story
                    </h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Magic is slowly vanishing from this world, leaving the coasts first, while the towns around the mountains still have an abundance of magic left.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The humans start to develop magical devices and recently also an option to refine the magic in the air and store it, to transport it to regions where it is vanishing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                             A few researchers have just started to look for the reason the magic is vanishing, as they fear it will never come back.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The main character comes from a farm for magical plants and herbs at the outskirts of the retreating magic.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The main character is a Magicborn, which means that he can feel the magic in the air and use it. He starts to feel the magic retreating from the farm.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To help his parents keep their business and to help stop the magic from vanishing, the main character travels to the largest city on the continent, which is renowned for its trade, but also for its magic schools and huge public libraries. He hopes to join the researchers there and join their efforts to find the source of the magic.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The game starts with the main character arriving at the port of the city.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            During the game, the player will need to get a hold of the researchers and help them gather more information about magic.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As the player works for the researchers, he slowly starts to figure out that there is a smaller group of them that wants to find the source first, only to monopolize it and use it as a way to gain influence and the highest standing in society.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The player will need to figure out how to reveal the conspiracy and actively work against them without getting into danger.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After much research and the magic vanishing further from the coast and the realisation that near the mountains is still a lot of magic left, the player starts an expedition into the mountains.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In the heart of the mountains, the player finds a colony of reclusive people that live in peace with the dragons that everyone else in the world believes to be extinct.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The player finds out that the dragons are the source of magic, and it seeps from them into the surrounding nature, where it cannot be contained forever. This is the reason why the magic now is slowly vanishing from the points furthest away from the mountains.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The player needs to figure out how to bring the dragons safely back to the world to keep the magic alive without enslaving the dragons.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In the end, the player successfully brings the dragons back into the world and defeats the organisation that wanted to monopolize the magic.
                        </li>

                    <h3>
                        The World
                    </h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            On the continent where the story plays, is a huge mountain range that looks like a dragon, if you view it from the air.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In the mountains the dragons were borne and it is the only place where they can get new children, which is why they always stayed close to them.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            At the beginning, dragons were huge beasts that did not really care about humans but also not actively hurt them, unless if they were in the way or threatening the dragons.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Then humans began to form friendships with dragons and the dragons gave their new friends the ability to control the magic that the dragons carried within them and left a piece of wherever they went.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Humans started to use the dragons in their wars to havoc mass destruction. After humans started to build dragon-safe castles, they wanted to attack other dragons and their riders. But the dragons did not want to kill their own family, and so they turned against the humans that used them and retreated into the mountains.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The Humans took that as a declaration of war and hunted the dragons through the mountains, till they believed that they killed all of them.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The Dragons though figured out how to use their magic to shrink considerably in size and change the appearance to be able to hide well in the nature.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            They could release large bursts of magic over the whole continent to expel it from their bodies, so that they could shrink. That led to them carrying much smaller amounts of magic in them, but they were able to fade into nature and survive the slaughter.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Some humans did not like the ruthless slaughter of their dragon friends and moved with them into the heart of the mountains to help them survive.
                        </li>
