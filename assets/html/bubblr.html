                You're an employee at a big Social Media company. Your role is to push or censor user posts from different filter bubbles - whichever aligns with the current requirements of your boss and is beneficial to your company. By pushing or censoring posts you increase or decrease the satisfaction of your boss and the popularity of the platform. If you make both your boss and the users happy enough by managing the posts correctly, you'll be rewarded with a promotion. However, if you make him too angry or turn the platform unpopular, you'll get fired.
                Some posts may not align with your moral compass, but still need to get pushed because it benefits the company's agenda. With others, you may fully agree, but still have to censor them out.
                But be careful! Blindly pushing or censoring posts may turn the boss or the users against you...

            <h3>
                Background of Bubblr
            </h3>

            <p class="padding">
                Bubblr was created in Unity by a group of 7 during the Global Game Jam 2025 over the course of 48 hours. The Group consisted of Timur Bauch who was our team leader and responsible for the UI, Elisa Johanna Woelk, our main 3D artist and also responsible for the UI, Luca Spirka who was our main sound designer and also worked on 3D models, Thomas Kontny who was our story writer and responsible for all Social Media Posts and Mails written by the boss, Bastian Kroll who was our lead programmer and me, working as assisting programmer.
            </p>

            <h3>
                My Part in Bubblr
            </h3>

            <p class="padding">
                I worked as a coding assistant on Bubblr. I was responsible for the implementation of the UI elements, the sounds and the social media posts.

                At the beginning I implemented the main Menu while our lead programmer worked on the first game mechanics in the main scene. After the main Menu was done, I worked on implementing the Posts which we included as ScriptableObjects. This task took a lot of time and after I was done most functions were already implemented so I worked on the in-game UI, mainly the eMail program and the interface of the social media platform Bubblr. In the end I implemented the sounds using the AudioManager from Unity to ensure that we could call every sound at specific moments through the code or through buttons.
