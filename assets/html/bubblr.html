                Bubblr was created within 48 hours during the Global Game Jam 2025 with the theme “bubble”. We worked in a group of 6, where I fulfilled the role as an assistant programmer. The goal with Bubblr was to complete the Game Jam and have a functional game at the end of our 48 hours.

            <p class="padding">
                You're an employee at a big Social Media company. Your role is to push or censor user posts from different filter bubbles - whichever aligns with the current requirements of your boss and is beneficial to your company. By pushing or censoring posts you increase or decrease the satisfaction of your boss and the popularity of the platform. If you make both your boss and the users happy enough by managing the posts correctly, you'll be rewarded with a promotion. However, if you make him too angry or turn the platform unpopular, you'll get fired.
                Some posts may not align with your moral compass, but still need to get pushed because it benefits the company's agenda. With others, you may fully agree, but still have to censor them out.
                But be careful! Blindly pushing or censoring posts may turn the boss or the users against you...

                My Part in Bubblr
            </h3>

            <p class="padding">
                I worked as a programming assistant on Bubblr. I was responsible for the implementation of the UI elements, the sounds and the social media posts.

                At the beginning I implemented the main menu while our lead programmer worked on the first game mechanics in the main scene. After the menu was done, I worked on implementing the posts which we included as ScriptableObjects. This task took a lot of time and after I was done, most functions were already implemented. So I worked on the in-game UI, mainly the email program and the interface of the social media platform Bubblr. In the end I implemented the sounds using the AudioManager from Unity.
