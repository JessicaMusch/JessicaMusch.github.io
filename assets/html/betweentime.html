                Between Time was developed during my 5th semester in a group of 3. The goal of the assignment was a project, that combined the real world with virtual reality. As a group we have decided on creating an escape room game, where one player has a puzzlebox in his hands which is linked to the Virtual Reality world, where the second player is playing in.

                Development
            </h3>

            <p class="padding">
                At the start of the project, we all worked together on the game design and the different ideas for the puzzles. After this, the two programmers from our team started with the fundamental functionalities and tested out if our idea with the micro-controller for the puzzle box worked. Meanwhile I started on concept for our models.    
                <br><br>
                In the beginning we decided on a simplistic and low-poly style for the models with a simple plain colour texture to prevent lag in the game. Therefore, all the models look simple in their form and detail. Nevertheless, I tried to give each model some detail to focus on. 
                <br><br>
                As it is the first puzzle, I started with the models for the Mayan puzzle. The pyramid is built out of simple cuboids with more detailed stairs as a focus point, as they are also integral for the result of the puzzle and for the solving process of the next one.From the medieval themed models, the altar with the candles and the book on top is the focus point, as it is also the main part of the puzzle. The steampunk puzzle looks impressive when you stand in front of it, because of the huge maze out of pipes. Because the pipes are already so detailed, I put a lot of metal rings around the machine the maze comes from, so that it doesn’t fade into the background next to the labyrinth. On the middle-platform are 3 pedestals for the timecubes, each modelled in style of their representing timeline to distinguish clearly where which timecube earned from which puzzle belongs. In the end I worked on some background models that float slowly around the islands during the game to distract the players from the important items in the foreground and to give the background some interest.
