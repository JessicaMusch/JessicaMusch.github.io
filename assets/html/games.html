                    <p>
                        Fall is a cosy and peaceful highscore hunting game in which the player portraits a forest witch that tries to collect the fruits that fall from the autumn trees while avoiding the heavy pumpkins.
                        <br><br>
                        The gameplay focuses on a relaxing experience and therefore introduces only a small challenge over time.

                    <p>
                        Between Time is a coop puzzle game that combines Virtual Reality with the real world. The players work together while being in different dimensions: player One is in a dimension between time and reality while player Two is in the real world and has a controller to interact with the other dimension. The players must communicate with each other to complete the puzzles within the given time and save the dimensions from collapsing.
                        <br><br>
                        The gameplay relies on good teamwork to solve all puzzles in the tight timeframe. While both players are in the same room during the game, they don’t know what the other player is seeing and therefore need to communicate clearly what is in front of them.

                        Bubblr is a simulation game for a moderator on a fictional social media platform. The task of the player is the regulation of each post that is written on the platform while taking into consideration the current opinion of the users and the current opinion of the boss of the company. If the player decides against the public opinion the platform will get negative feedback, but if he decides against the opinion of the boss he risks getting fired.

                        This game is part of the 2025 Global Game Jam with the theme “Bubble” and references filter bubbles in the internet. The game and its social media posts are made to criticise the society and especially the behaviour on social media platforms.

                        Disclaimer: This game should be viewed as satire.

                        Capyspara is a cosy mobile game in which the player builds their own spa and meets the Capybara’s every needs through playing a matching-game to acquire resources for the spa.
                        <br><br>
                        The gameplay focuses on building an aesthetic spa area for the Capybaras and on the ability to play this game during short breaks in the day. Capyspara enables the player to only play a quick and relaxing round of the matching-game or satisfy the needs of a few cute Capybaras before going back to the daily grind.

                    <p>
                        “Vanishing Magic” is a concept for a fantasy RPG in which the player controls a young Magicborn man who tries to find the reason to the vanishing of the magic from the world. While trying to find the origin of the problem, he gets tangled in between allies with the same goal and an enemy organisation who wants to monopolise the magic by finding its source first.
                        <br><br>
                        The gameplay is focused on exploring the world and gaining important knowledge about it through the research the player can conduct with his skills. Different skills find out different information about the same object and higher skills help the player discover more detailed information. The exploring and gathering of knowledge about the world helps the player greatly to piece together the functioning of the magic and ultimately its origin, while ignoring the world and its wealth of information might get the player only barely to the desired end.
