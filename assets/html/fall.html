                Fall
            </h1>

            <p class="padding">
                I created Fall as an assignment in my 4th semester within a few weeks in Unity and worked on all aspects of the game myself - the game design, art and code. I kept the game design deliberately simple to make sure I had a completely finished and polished game by the given deadline. After the concept of the game was finished, I wrote the code and worked with placeholder objects till I finished the art in the end.

                My development process
            </h3>

            <p class="padding">
                At the beginning I worked on the game design of Fall and made a list of all necessary features that were needed for the assignment and all other gameplay features that I wanted to add. As I knew that I would realistically only have a few weeks to make the whole game, I kept the features to a minimum. After I had my list of features, I started to implement all the basic functionalities like the movement of the character or the spawning and spawnrate for the different objects. Then I started to flesh out the game and added the menus, sound effects, background music and the settings. In the end I worked on the pixel art to replace all my placeholder objects with the correct sprites and playtested the game to eliminate the last remaining bugs that I missed during the development.

            <h3>
                What I would add to Fall 
            </h3>


            <p class="padding">
                Looking back at Fall, I would now make a few things different. Firstly, I would add a different sound effect for the acorns to let the player know that he just got more points from the item. Additionally I would add a few more features to make the gameplay more interesting. Currently the player only needs to move left and right and avoid all the pumpkins. I believe that by adding a few more special items the gameplay could be enhanced without taking away the relaxing part of the game. For example: I would add another item that takes away points from the players and to counteract this, I would also add an rare item that adds a heart to the players life-counter. Also there could be other objects falling down that stay for a second or two on the ground and block the players path temporarily.
